, 'abstract': 'The common wisdom is that computer languages are not like human lanuages. Period.\nWell, although the computer science master\'s thesis was ostensibly on "first-class control", what it really did was indulge my love of constructing languages, and it even cited a linguistics paper.\nSince I\'ve had deep experience in the construction of both human and computer languages, I may as well look at the difference.\nIt turns out there are more connections than I had at first thought.\n'
