<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
Iskki is definitely phonologically odd.
Its main laryngeal distinction can only be described as a fortis-lenis contrast.
Depending on the context, this can show up as aspiration, voicing, and sometimes as ejectives.
It has no bilabials, but does have labiovelars.
In addition to the common /ɾ, l/, it also has /ʟ, ʀ/.

<p>
I this language, I've expanded my allophony technique.
Not only are there regular phonological processes, such as voicing intervocalic lenis stops, but there are also variations which are not conditioned.
I've bothered to list out how some sounds can be realized in either of two ways, apparently randomly.
It's not like I've researched this, but I've run into it twice now in different natlangs, so I think it's quite natural, and yet I've not seen this in conlangs.
