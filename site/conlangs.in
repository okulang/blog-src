For now, I'm just pointing you to the old site.
I'll do a rewrite to that information later.

<h3><a href="iskki.html">Iskki Leke'sou</a></h3>
<p>
A language for my own use.
To push my brain, I've decided to use OSV word order and some screwy ergativity.
On the other hand, to give my brain a sense of familiarity (nostalgia?) I'm trying to use Jatin and Japanese to inspire morphology.
On the gripping hand, I've made sure to include things I think are cool, like ejectives and telefixes.

<h3><a href="myrkoldh.html">Myrkolð</a></h3>
<p>
A language inspired by some songs on Old Norse, so mainly built for sound.
Words will have polyconsonantal roots, something like Arabic, where the choice of vowels will be fossilized harmony.
